# Euler_spiral

Purpose: This program shows the Euler spiral and one of its many applications.

Requirements: This program requires python 3.1 or newer. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
              This program requires pygame for python 3.1 or newer. (https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads)

General: I used this to present the Euler spiral as a project in my math class. The moving circle represents 
         Euler's spiral's uses with roller coaster.
